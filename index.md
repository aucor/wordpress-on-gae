## Hi all, this site is now a bit outdated since many things have been changed. Read & use with caution.

&nbsp;

Getting a Wordpress site up and running on Google App Engine isn't that hard. Google provides some instructions and even [a starter project][wpstarter] to set things properly up. But many steps are still ahead on the path of developing and publishing a full-featured, production ready and quality website.

To overcome these barriers we've spent couple nights reading documentations and code, googling, browsing StackOverflow and deploying new site versions hundreds of times. But we have learnt many things. That's why we created this site. To gather the knowledge about the platform so it'll be easier for the rest.
